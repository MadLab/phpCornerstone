            <h4>Where is the Documentation?</h4>
            <p>All developers agree that documentation is good. They also all agree that it's a pain to write them, this is why there are no docs yet. Bother us if you want them sooner.</p>

            <h4>What templating system does it use?</h4>
            <p>Smarty, with some tooling to make things a bit easier to use with the phpCornerstone framework.</p>

            <h4>Where can I find out more information?</h4>
            <p>Right now it's really just from looking at the code. We haven't gotten around to anything else yet.</p>

            <h4>Is anything ready?</h4>
            <p>Well the code works, we've been using it for a while, but you have to realize you are asking me all these questions literally the minute I started putting up our site.</p>

            <h4>Who's behind this... thing?</h4>
            <p><a href="http://www.madlab.com/is/nickashley">Nick Ashley</a> is the lead programmer. <a href="http://www.madlab.com/is/robertgentel">Robert Gentel</a> occasionally contributes to the project.</p>
