phpCornerstone
==============

phpCornerstone is a MVC framework focused on code organization, intelligent routing, and facilitating DRY principles.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

phpCornerstone was built on the Apache server, with PHP 5.3 and above. We aren't saying that it 
won't work with other configurations, just that they're untested. 


INSTALLATION
------------

Just place everything in the public_html folder. Then, just CHMOD 777 the 'storage' folder. You should see the following:

- **cornerstone/** - phpCornerstone core files
- **helpers/** - Place helper functions, typically containing static functions, here. Helpers are auto-loaded.
- **libraries/** - 3rd party code libraries, etc go here. Libraries can be loaded with $cs->loadLibrary();
- **models/** - Your applications models go here. They will be auto-loaded. 
- **pages/** - Controllers and Views both go here, and will be auto-mapped to URLs.
- **storage/** - Place for template cache, and any storage your app may need. Chmod 777 this folder. 
- **webRoot/** - Acts as the new 'public_html' folder - can place non-app code, static files, etc here
- **.htaccess** - Apache file required for phpCornerstone to work
- **config.php** - Config
- **routes.php** - File for defining custom URL mapping


THE END

In the future we would love to have proper documentation, tutorials, reference material, etc. Until then, this is the best you got (sorry). Contact Us if you have any questions, or would like to help out.
